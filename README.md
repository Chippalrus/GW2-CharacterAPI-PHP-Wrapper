# Guild Wars 2 API - Character - PHP
- Uses ParallelCurl by petewarden ( https://github.com/petewarden/ParallelCurl ).

# Description
I disliked GW2 web-apps that were available at the time so, I made my own.
My focus was to share my character's Builds/Equipment via a single URL without need of registering account and to display information in a compact manner without needless information.

This is just the *backend* of the project that I have built. I am aware of what is currently avaliable, however, I do not want to include methods I wont be using from other wrappers.

# Features

## Caching
## API Request calls
## Character Data
