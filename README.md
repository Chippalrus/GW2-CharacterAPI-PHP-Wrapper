# Guild Wars 2 API - Character - PHP Wrapper
- Uses ParallelCurl by petewarden ( https://github.com/petewarden/ParallelCurl ).

# Description
I disliked GW2 web-apps that were available at the time so, I made my own.
My focus was ability to share my character's Builds/Equipment via a single URL without need of registering account and to display information in a compact manner without needless information.

# Features

## Caching
## API Request calls
## Character Data
